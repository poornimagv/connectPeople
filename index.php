<p style="text-align: justify;"> Connect People is the use of small amounts of capital from a large number of individuals to finance a new business venture. Connect People makes use of the easy accessibility of vast networks of people through social media and Connect People websites to bring investors and entrepreneurs together, and has the potential to increase entrepreneurship by expanding the pool of investors from whom funds can be raised beyond the traditional circle of owners, relatives and venture capitalists.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Connect People campaigns are where new and groundbreaking products take flight, sometimes long before they hit mainstream availability. With thousands of campaigns launching every week, there's great tech, design, and much more around every corner - often with limited-time perks and pricing for the earliest backers. Before it's everywhere, it's on Connect People.</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Connect People is collecting small sums of money from multiple people for a specific project, business venture or social cause. 
It uses a web-based platform or social networking sites to solicit funds for the fundraiser by showcasing the story to potential donors or investors. 
According to the rules in India, equity-based Connect People is illegal, whereas peer-to-peer lending is regulated by the RBI. Community Connect People which includes donation based and rewards-based Connect People are legal and are quite popular to raise funds for social causes. The Connect People websites typically charge a fee for using their platform and services to bring money for the cause </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Connect People has become a loaded term, meaning so much more than just raising money from the public. In fact, it means different things to different people. New and old terms are sometimes being used to describe the same or similar activities. Here, I’ll break it down in hopes of bringing greater clarity to a question that still gets asked every day: what is crowdfunding?

Nonprofits use crowdfunding to gather donations. They often refer to crowdfunding as “online fundraising,” “social media fundraising” or “peer-to-peer fundraising.”</p>

						<div class="col-md-8">
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unconditional capital from crowdfunded sources could serve as a vital source of money for them to learn and experiment with new opportunities for impact. Crowd funding from hundreds of individuals also pushes nonprofits to improve their storytelling around their impact to engage this retail donor base </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you’re an early-stage company focused on building your business and attracting seed capital, you might not be able to afford all the time and attention that pursuing traditional financing demands. Compared to applying for a loan or seeking out accredited investors yourself, setting up a successful Connect People campaign on Fundable or another platform is far more efficient and effective in getting your message out to the right people. With the right platform, you can tell your business’s story, produce a quick video, set up some enticing rewards, and benefit from having everything in one centralized location where potential backers can find you </p>
